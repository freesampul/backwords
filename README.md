# backwords

This is the code behind backwords.xyz!

It is a fully functioning web page that hosts and image generated by an ai. 
Everyday, the image is replaced and users can guess what the prompt to generate the image was.

Each guess is ranked in "closeness" (semantic similarity) to the actually word.
A score between 25,000 and 1 is returned, indicating how close their guess was.
Users are also told if they have any letters in common with the actual word.

This game was intially created for a hackathon by Sam and Andrew and is now a fully functioning app!
